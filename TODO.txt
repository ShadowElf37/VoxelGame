- barriers for texture loading
- second render pass for UI
- generate cube faces, and instancing, only send block or tex ID to gpu
- transparency pass?

- frame in flight
- pause menu (note: due to current lack of pause condition for keybinds, some bugs with cursor behavior)
- fog





lighting, physics in thread
own their own clocks (change nomenclature to "tick" instead of "frame")
have internal fences to rate limit
access lighting array and e.pos/e.vel (or make a new e.PhysState) using mutex
event_loop accesses mutexes more/less often than they're written to


cpu/compute calculates visible FACES
GPU instance the faces, have an array on gpu of visible faces with texture ids

saving chunks is just block_id,BlockProto does most of the work

camera at 1.8m
